 * cgfs-ng.c: this is a new, simplified implementation of a filesystem
 * cgroup backend.  The original cgfs.c was designed to be as flexible
 * as possible.  It would try to find cgroup filesystems no matter where
 * or how you had them mounted, and deduce the most usable mount for
 * each controller.  It also was not designed for unprivileged use, as
 * that was reserved for cgmanager.
 *
 * This new implementation assumes that cgroup filesystems are mounted
 * under /sys/fs/cgroup/clist where clist is either the controller, or
 * a comman-separated list of controllers.
